work in progress

reactJS + shad/cn frontend

go + gin backend

hosted on ec2


## update ##
it used to be available at https://www.leagueofmatchups.ai/ but somehow the server started calling claude in an infinite loop
and left me with a $400 AWS Bedrock bill 

Will investigate the issue and bring it back up as soon as i can
