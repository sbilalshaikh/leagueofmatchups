Going boneplating is really important, and you have to really fight him based on his cds. If he doesnt have fury, you dont have to be scared as he wont one shot you. Baiting out his double dash is usually your biggest window to all in him, because you win if he cant disengage}

They like to run ignite too so you’ll end up getting chunked and zoned. If he starts Q, you can win level 1. Renekton has a very bad level 1 despite him being a lane bully. If you can gain a hp advantage level 1 then he can’t bully you anymore. If he starts W then you can’t fight him at all. Until level 6. You need to take calculated short trades against him. Q W Auto E out. The reason for this is because they will often attempt to stun you immediately after. E will mitigate this damage if you mess up the timing and get caught by it. Typically you can do this without him being able to react at all though if you pick your moments. If he’s above 40% rage, don’t trade. He can generate it quickly with a dash through the wave and chunk you with an empowered W. If you used CDs then he can chase you with second dash and finish with empowered Q for a very one sided trade. If you are short trading properly, you will generate a slight health advantage. Once he’s 50% and you’re above 60% you can all in and win. Baring in mind his extra hp from his R and increased fury generation you will want to do this after he uses his Q to clear, farm or generate fury. If he gets an empowered Q off during your all in, he will beat you especially if it’s inside a minion wave. You will outscale him, so even if you can’t pull off the level 6 all in - he can’t contest you post 2 items without a lead. Bone plating is vital for this matchup as he can really only all in. His CDs are long so he risks a lot by trying to short trade. Mitigating the upfront burst will help you out trade his combo. Doran’s shield is great too if you’re not experienced. Long sword is great though if your proficient with the champion and familiar with the matchup. Having extra damage gives you kill pressure much earlier but you need to be able to play the matchup properly otherwise you will lose very hard with greedy itemisation.}

Sure you can make it Work, but not worth the stress imo. But Here some things that worked for me: rush Armor and tabis. Chainvest is a pretty good start and If you really dont wanna die you can Go into the deaths Dancer First but you will lack sustain this way. So my fav build is D sword into tabis First Item hyrda for the ad, sustain and cdr and throw cloth armor into chainvest in whenever you feel like you need it. After that you can Go the usal build. Also never E when E pretty near you, he will just W you in your E Animation which means He gets the shield break W damage and a free Q since you are stunned for a little Bit. Try instead to WE so He cant hit the free Q or W and E after to shield His Q dmg. At Level 11 you can win every 2nd all in, cause His R cd is 120 seconds flat, so your R will be Up before he can R again. You can Go ignite for early kill pressure and some free antiheal in all ins. But I still prefer TP, because you can Take a free base which can Safe your ass pretty regulary. As example If you die to a Dive or have to sacrifyse your HP to break a freeze. Ignite is good If enemy plays strongside bot, but usally if the enemy jgl sees a Top without tp, He will gank the sh*t Out of it, cause, what you wanna do? Fight a Level 5 jgl + Renekton? Jokes on you. And then after they Crashed the crocodile has a free freeze. Therefore I usally Play TP. 
Also If you Stack Armor its worth to E His empowered E since it gives 30% Armor shred, which is Sometimes more usefull than shielding His W or Q.}
